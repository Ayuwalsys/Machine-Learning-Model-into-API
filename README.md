# Machine-Learning-Model-into-API

This is a Machine learning classification model turned into API. In this repo we have 
- The dataset in csv format,  
- Model.py file: this is where logistic regression is used to build the model.
- Api.py: we did the importation of the python libraries such as flask, joblib, sklearn e.t.c. Also did the configuration of the route and also load the model. 
- The API was tested locally using POSTMAN
